This directory contains jupyter notebooks and scripts used to train models and analyze data.

1. Basic-Data: a python notebook used to plot various basic information about our dataset
2. Binarize-Features: a python notebook used to validate our decision to binarize the data showing
	* the original distribution of our ordinal data
	* concordance between instrument diagnoses for ADIR and ADOS
	* concordance of instrument diagnostic algorithms using ordinal vs binarized data
	* concordance of instrument diagnostic algorithms vs new diagnostic algorithms created via L1-regularized logistic regression applied to the ordinal data
	* concordance of instrument diagnostic algorithms vs new diagnostic algorithms created via L1-regularized logistic regression applied to binarized data
